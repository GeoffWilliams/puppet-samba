# Puppet Samba Module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GeoffWilliams/puppet-samba.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GeoffWilliams/puppet-samba)

Module for provisioning Samba

## Usage
See reference and examples

## Reference
[generated documentation](https://rawgit.com/GeoffWilliams/puppet-filemagic/master/doc/index.html).

Reference documentation is generated directly from source code using [puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings).  You may regenerate the documentation by running:

```shell
bundle exec puppet strings
```


The documentation is no substitute for reading and understanding the module source code, and all users should ensure they are familiar and comfortable with the operations this module performs before using it.

Based on an original module hosted at https://github.com/ajjahn/puppet-samba.  Since upstream looks dormant, I created a new module updated for Puppet 4 and including a customer patch.
